Summary: Implement 2 pages with the purpose of letting user to post their ideas. (If you don't know what is a "idea forum" please take a look at https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/ad198462-1c1c-ec11-b6e7-0022481f8472)

Requirements:
- developer should use flowbite components (https://flowbite.com/compnents) and blocks (https://flowbite.com/blocks) as much as possible to create both pages. (Note: I have pro license and you can require me the code of a component/ block if you need it)
- make your request to fit in the current design
- will work on github repo provided and work on a different branch.
- split the code in components ( I don't need go to deep in components tree structure if is not the case. )
- use dummy data and implement minimal logic if is needed (e.g: If you choose to add comment into a modal form make the component to keep the state. Don't implement REST API or create a dummy server in Nuxt)
- if you need to use icons please use official tailwind icons (https://heroicons.com/)

"Ideas" page description:
- on this page should display the "Idea card" and filters and orders section (component)


"Idea details" page description:
- on this page you should display the idea component, other people comments and also have a way to add comments on the current idea.

Note: Because I am looking for a long time collaboration I will look also on the quality of the code.
